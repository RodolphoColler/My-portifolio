          <p class='my-description'>
            As you know my name is Rodolpho, i live in state of 
            SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Right now i'm adding back-end to my
            list of tools, so in some time i gonna be a full-stack
            developer.
            I'm curious programmer, like to improve my abilities,
            refactor code, and see problems from another approach.
            Starting from that i'm search for a job that i can 
            contribute and be open to learn good programming.
